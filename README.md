# Exercise 11

For the last exercise of the course, I want to give you the opportunity to explore a dataset with out giving you too many directions. The only thing that I definitely want you to do is create a program that uses a pandas data frame to do some analysis as well as create a plot. The data set that you use is up to you as is the type of analysis. You are free to do essentially what I demonstrated in this week's lesson, or you can be creative and go in your own direction.

For data, we have used NOAA's [NCEI](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) several times in this course. The marine data that I used in lesson 11 came from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/marine.

Again, be as creative with this assignment as you would like. Create and commit the file to your remote repo as you normally would when you are finished.
